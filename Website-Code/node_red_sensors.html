        <h1>Sensors for Hydroponics with Node-RED</h1>
        <p>Below are some commonly used sensors in hydroponics, their functions, and a step-by-step explanation on how to integrate them with Node-RED and an ESP32 microcontroller.</p>
        
        <h2>1. pH Sensor</h2>
        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This sensor measures how acidic or basic the water is. Plants need the right pH level to absorb nutrients properly.</p>
        <h3>How to connect:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Find the pH sensor and its probe.</li>
            <li>Connect the sensor's signal output wire to an analog pin on the ESP32.</li>
            <li>Power the sensor by connecting the VCC wire to 3.3V or 5V on the ESP32 and the GND wire to the ground.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to use with Node-RED:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set up an MQTT connection between the ESP32 and Node-RED.</li>
            <li>Read the pH sensor values from the ESP32 and send them via MQTT.</li>
            <li>In Node-RED, use a gauge node to display the pH values on a dashboard.</li>
            <li>Set up alerts if the pH goes out of the ideal range.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>2. EC Sensor</h2>
        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This sensor measures the electrical conductivity (EC) of water to determine how many nutrients are present.</p>
        <h3>How to connect:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Attach the EC sensor probe to its signal board.</li>
            <li>Connect the signal wire to an analog input on the ESP32.</li>
            <li>Power the EC sensor by connecting it to 3.3V/5V and ground.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to use with Node-RED:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Program the ESP32 to read EC values and send them to Node-RED via MQTT.</li>
            <li>In Node-RED, create a visual graph to monitor changes over time.</li>
            <li>Use function nodes to send alerts if the EC level is too high or too low.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>3. Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT22)</h2>
        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Measures air temperature and humidity levels in the hydroponics environment.</p>
        <h3>How to connect:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect the DHT22 sensor’s data pin to a digital pin on the ESP32.</li>
            <li>Provide power by connecting the VCC pin to 3.3V/5V and GND to ground.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to use with Node-RED:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use an ESP32 program to read temperature and humidity values.</li>
            <li>Send these values to Node-RED using MQTT.</li>
            <li>Use a chart node in Node-RED to display the temperature and humidity trends.</li>
            <li>Trigger notifications when conditions go beyond ideal growing ranges.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>4. Water Level Sensor</h2>
        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Ensures that the hydroponic system has enough water.</p>
        <h3>How to connect:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Attach the water level sensor to the side of the water tank.</li>
            <li>Connect its signal wire to an analog or digital pin on the ESP32.</li>
            <li>Power the sensor by connecting it to 3.3V/5V and ground.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to use with Node-RED:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Program the ESP32 to read water level data and send it to Node-RED.</li>
            <li>Use a bar graph in Node-RED to show water levels.</li>
            <li>Set up an automated water pump control when levels get too low.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>5. Light Sensor</h2>
        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Measures light intensity to ensure plants receive the correct amount of light.</p>
        <h3>How to connect:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect the light sensor’s signal output to an analog pin on the ESP32.</li>
            <li>Power the sensor with 3.3V/5V and connect ground.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to use with Node-RED:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Read sensor values from the ESP32 and send them via MQTT.</li>
            <li>In Node-RED, display light intensity using a gauge.</li>
            <li>Use a function node to trigger LED grow lights when natural light is too low.</li>
        </ol>
