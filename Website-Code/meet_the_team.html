                                <p>
                                    I am a 21-year-old Data Science student from Hartbeespoort, South Africa. 
                                    My entire life revolves around my family, I am the oldest of 5 siblings.  
                                    I am very passionate about coding, problem-solving, and building user-friendly applications. 
                                    My hobbies include gaming, farming, restoring vintage cars, and exploring nature.

                                    To me, engineering is about designing efficient solutions, analyzing problems critically,
                                    and creating systems that will improve people's lives — 
                                    whether it's done through data, software, or infrastructure.
                                </p>

                                    I love turning ideas into reality using logic and creativity. 
                                    Engineering lets me solve real-world challenges while continuously learning and innovating.

                                    I have helped a few local businesses create small scale sales and generally management applications for windows. 
                                    I have also worked on many small projects that involved Arduino microcontrollers and sensors, 
                                    such as building security cameras and GPS trackers.

                                    In 2021, I worked on a solar system project where we designed 
                                    and built cost-effective solar power solutions for individuals. 
                                    The goal was to make renewable energy more accessible and affordable, 
                                    and it was an amazing experience to apply engineering principles to something that directly benefits people's daily lives.

                                    Engineering, to me, is being able to bring anything you can imagine to life. 
                                    It is a job where you problem-solve and create solutions to any problem thrown your way.

                                <p>
                                    I want to be an engineer because I love to create and build things. 
                                    Engineering is a career where you can do that. I also love to problem-solve, 
                                    and engineering is all about doing that. Lastly, I want to help people through my job and by engineering products, 
                                    I can make a big impact on people around the world.
