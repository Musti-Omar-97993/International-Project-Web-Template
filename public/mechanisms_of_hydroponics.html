                    <h2>Macronutrients (plants need a lot of these):</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Nitrogen (N):</strong> Helps plants grow green leaves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Phosphorus (P):</strong> Helps roots grow and supports flowers and fruits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Calcium (Ca):</strong> Builds strong cell walls.</li>
                        <li><strong>Magnesium (Mg):</strong> Needed for photosynthesis and making chlorophyll.</li>

                    <h2>Micronutrients (plants only need a little):</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Iron (Fe):</strong> Helps make chlorophyll and supports healthy growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu):</strong> Help plants grow using enzymes and hormones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boron (B), Molybdenum (Mo), Chlorine (Cl):</strong> Help roots grow and move nutrients through the plant.</li>

                    <h2>How Plants Get Nutrients in Hydroponics</h2>
                    <p>In hydroponics, plants don’t grow in soil. Instead, their roots sit in water that has all the nutrients they need. This helps plants grow faster and stay healthy!</p>

                    <h2>Types of Hydroponic Systems</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Nutrient Film Technique (NFT):</strong> 
                            A thin stream of water flows over the roots, giving plants food. 
                            The water is collected and used again. The pump must stay on!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Deep Water Culture (DWC):</strong> 
                            Roots hang in bubbly water with nutrients. 
                            It’s great for plants like lettuce, but the water has to stay cool.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Drip System:</strong> 
                            Tubes drip water with nutrients onto each plant’s roots. 
                            It’s easy to adjust for different kinds of plants.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ebb & Flow:</strong> 
                            Plants sit in a tray filled with clay balls. 
                            Water floods the tray, then drains out, giving roots food and air.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Aeroponics:</strong> 
                            Roots hang in the air and get sprayed with a mist of water and nutrients. 
                            Plants grow super fast, but it needs careful setup!

                    <h2>Oxygenation & Water Circulation Mechanisms</h2>
                    <p>Water movement and oxygenation are vital in hydroponics to ensure healthy root systems, nutrient uptake, and to prevent disease. Here's how they work together:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mechanisms-content">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Air Pumps & Air Stones:</strong> 
                            Especially used in Deep Water Culture (DWC) systems, air pumps push air through porous stones, 
                            creating bubbles that dissolve oxygen into the water. 
                            This oxygen is critical for root respiration and nutrient absorption.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Passive Aeration:</strong> 
                            In systems like NFT and aeroponics, 
                            roots are exposed to air or misted frequently, hich provides natural oxygen intake. 
                            Ensuring consistent airflow and humidity prevents roots from drying out or becoming oxygen-deprived.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Pumps & Timers:</strong> 
                            Circulating pumps move nutrient-rich water through the system, 
                            while timers automate cycles—especially in ebb & flow setups. 
                            This ensures that roots are neither waterlogged nor dried out, 
                            maintaining a balance between moisture and air.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Gravity Flow:</strong> 
                            Systems like NFT often use a slight slope and gravity to 
                            allow water to flow naturally over the roots and back into the reservoir. 
                            This reduces mechanical complexity and energy consumption.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Proper circulation prevents stagnation, distributes oxygen and nutrients evenly, 
                        and keeps pH and temperature consistent. A well-aerated, well-circulated system leads to healthier plants and faster growth.</p>

                    <h2>Structural Support Mechanisms</h2>
                    <p>Without soil to anchor them, plants need alternative support. Hydroponic systems use various structures to hold plants in place and support their growth:</p>

                            Little baskets that hold the plant while letting the roots grow down into the water. 
                            They keep plants steady without squeezing the roots.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Growing Media:</strong> 
                            Special stuff like clay balls or coconut fiber that holds the plant in place and keeps roots wet and healthy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Trellises & Frames:</strong> 
                            Stands or nets that help big plants like tomatoes and beans grow upward and not fall over.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Rafts:</strong> 
                            Floating boards that plants sit on while their roots dangle into the water below to drink up nutrients.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Support Rings & Clips:</strong> 
                            Small clips and rings that gently hold plant stems up so they don’t bend or break as they grow.
                        </li>

                    <h2>Environmental Control Mechanisms</h2>
                    <p>Creating the right environment is key to healthy plant growth. Hydroponics allows us to fine-tune environmental factors for optimal results. Here’s how each component contributes to plant performance:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="mechanisms-content">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Temperature & Humidity:</strong> 
                            Plants like it not too hot, not too cold (about 18–26°C). 
                            If it’s too humid, plants can get moldy. 
                            Tools like heaters, coolers, and humidifiers help keep everything just right.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lighting:</strong> 
                            Plants need light to grow. 
                            Special LED lights give plants the kind of light they need, like blue for growing leaves and red for making flowers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Air Flow:</strong> 
                            Fans move the air around to keep plants healthy, 
                            helping them breathe better and stopping bugs and mold from taking over.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>pH & Nutrients:</strong> 
                            Plants need water that's not too sour or too basic (pH 5.5–6.5). 
                            They also need the right amount of food (nutrients), not too much or too little!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide):</strong> 
                            Plants breathe in CO₂ to grow faster. 
                            Sometimes, we add extra CO₂ to help them, but only just the right amount!
                        </li>
                    </ul>                    
                    <p>By controlling these environmental elements, growers can optimize plant health, reduce stress, and achieve higher yields consistently, regardless of external weather or seasonal changes.</p>
