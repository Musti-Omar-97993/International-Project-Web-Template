                    <mark>Objective:</mark> 
                    Deepen our understanding of hydroponic systems by studying historical methods 
                    (e.g., ancient Chinese rice hydroponics) and modern practices such as the 
                    Nutrient Film Technique (NFT). We analyzed prior designs built at 
                    Pennsylvania State University (Figure 4) to identify strengths and limitations. 
                    Special focus was given to sensor technologies, IoT integrations, and system modularity for portability.

                    Translate research findings into actionable goals while ensuring practicality for classroom demonstration. 
                    We emphasized modularity, airline-compliant sizing, and resilience during transport. 
                    Lightweight materials like PVC and HDPE containers were selected for portability, and reliable, 
                    low-power electronics (Arduino-based) were chosen to simplify field repairs and assembly challenges. 
                    This approach allows for easy scalability and customization based on environmental factors in different regions

                    <mark>Objective:</mark> 
                    Develop a working prototype integrating the Drip system 
                    with portable and resilient design. The system featured collapsible frame sections, 
                    quick-connect joints, compact submersible pumps, and an enhanced sensor suite (EC, pH, temperature, flow). 
                    These updates aimed to ensure functionality in diverse conditions while making the setup easy to transport and assemble. 
                    Stress tests simulated environmental exposures and travel vibrations, ensuring the systemâ€™s durability for educational use.

                    Conduct rigorous testing to ensure the system's robustness under real-world conditions. 
                    We simulated movement, partial disassembly, and reassembly, with an emphasis on water flow, sensor accuracy,
                    and leak-proofing. Based on testing feedback, we made multiple design revisions to reinforce weak joints, 
                    calibrate sensors, and optimize power usage, ensuring the system's effectiveness in both classroom and field environments.

                    Successfully transport and assemble the hydroponics system at Spa Park, Bela-Bela, 
                    while engaging middle school students in interactive learning. Our goal is to provide hands-on educational 
                    activities that demonstrate the principles of hydroponics in an accessible and fun way. We are creating simplified 
                    visuals and activities tailored for young students, while emphasizing sustainability and engineering. 
                    The system design will encourage curiosity about environmental science and sustainable agriculture, aligning with international teamwork and cultural sensitivity.
